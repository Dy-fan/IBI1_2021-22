Line number: 42-49

Answer:
Yes, there are places in theWorld where there have not yet been more than 10 total infections.
The places are as followed in the list. The number of them is 42.
['Angola', 'Anguilla', 'Antigua and Barbuda', 'Belize', 'Benin', 'Bhutan', 'British Virgin Islands', 'Cape Verde',
'Central African Republic', 'Chad', 'Falkland Islands', 'Fiji', 'Gabon', 'Gambia', 'Greenland', 'Grenada',
'Guinea-Bissau', 'Guyana', 'Laos', 'Liberia', 'Libya', 'Mariana Islands', 'Mauritania', 'Montserrat', 'Mozambique',
'Nepal', 'Nicaragua', 'Papua New Guinea', 'Saint Kitts and Nevis', 'Saint Lucia', 'Saint Vincent and the Grenadines',
'Seychelles', 'Somalia', 'South Sudan', 'Sudan', 'Suriname', 'Swaziland', 'Syria', 'Timor', 'Turks and Caicos Islands',
'Vatican', 'Zimbabwe']

I did not expect there are so many places that have only this few infections.
The reason why these places only have few infections may be that these places only have small population and are very
small in scale. These places may be quite remote and the transportation is not good, so few people would come, not to
mention infected ones, thereby the overall number of infections is quite low.
