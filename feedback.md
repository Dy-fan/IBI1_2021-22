Labels were lost in my scatter plot and boxplot of code for week 6.

1.I added x and y labels in the file 'List manipulation.py'

plt.ylabel('marks')
plt.xlabel('Student Rob')

2.added title,x and y labels in the file 'Parental age vs offspring health.py'

plt.title('The risk of congenital heart disease in the offspring of a father along with age')
plt.xlabel('age of the father')
plt.ylabel('numbers relative to offspring with a 25-year-old father')
