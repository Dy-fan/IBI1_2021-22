Not everthing went well. Actually I spent a lot of time finishing this prectical.
At the beggining I did not fully understand the structure of git and the meaning of some commands, so I just simple followed the instructions to type the commends given, 
thereby making some things wrong like I named all three commitments "Initialise".
I ran into some problems such as not knowing how to exit the page that appeared after I entered the commnent "git revert HEAD" and not really sure how to use "git push".
Thanks to the generous help of our facilitator, I successfully solved all those problems and finished the practical.
