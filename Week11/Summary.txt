Findings:
comparison between DLX5_HUMAN and DLX5_MOUSE:
the score of alignment is: 1490
the percentage of identical amino acids is: 96.54%

comparison between DLX5_HUMAN and RandomSe:
the score of alignment is: -351
the percentage of identical amino acids is: 2.77%

comparison between DLX5_MOUSE and RandomSe:
the score of alignment is: -348
the percentage of identical amino acids is: 3.11%

interpretation:
comparison between DLX5_HUMAN and DLX5_MOUSE showed the highest score and the percentage of identical amino acids is way
much higher than the other two, indicating there is great similarity between human and mouse DLX5 gene.
This similarity may indicate that these two, human and mouse, might evolve from the same species very long ago.
The similarity between random sequence and human or mouse gene is quite low, which may indicate that high similarity
between mouse and human gene here is not a random outcome. The sequence of gene encode certain protein in these two
might follow certain pattern.
